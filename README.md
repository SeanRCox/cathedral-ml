## Cathedral Machine Learning Algorithm

Cathedral is a two-player pure abstract strategy board game designed by Robert 
Moore and was created and published in 1979. The game is similar to the popular Chinese 
game Go, but with some crucial gameplay and stylistic changes. As in Go, the strategy behind 
Cathedral is complex, and here we investigate the ability of a machine learning algorithm to play 
the game.
